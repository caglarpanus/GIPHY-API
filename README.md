# GIPHY-API
AJAX Practice

* I created this app in order to improve my skills in AJAX and JavaScript. 
* I created this is an app by using GIPHY API in order to create a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 

### This app displays buttons related to a certain topic and allows you to add search terms to generate additional buttons that when clicked, accesses the GIPHY API and generates 10 static GIPHY images. Click on an image to pause or play the GIF.

* When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
* When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
* Every gif is displayed its rating (PG, G, etc.).
